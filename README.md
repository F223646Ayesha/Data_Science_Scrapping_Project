# NeurIPS Paper Scraper

This repository contains two scripts (`NeurIPSWebScraper.java` and `scraper.py`) for scraping research papers from the NeurIPS website. The scripts extract paper metadata (title, authors, year, PDF URL) and download the PDFs into organized folders.

## How to Run

### Running the Python Script
```bash
python scraper.py
```
This will:
âœ… Scrape NeurIPS papers from multiple years  
âœ… Download PDFs into year-based folders  
âœ… Save metadata to `output.csv`

### Running the Java Script
Compile and run the Java program:

```bash
javac -cp .;jsoup.jar;httpclient.jar NeurIPSWebScraper.java  
```
This will:
âœ… Scrape NeurIPS papers from multiple years  
âœ… Download PDFs into year-based folders  
âœ… Save metadata to `output.json`

---

## Output Files
- `output.csv` (Python): Contains extracted paper metadata in CSV format
- **Downloaded PDFs**: Saved in separate folders by year

## Responsible Scraping
ðŸš€ Follow these best practices:
âœ… Respect `robots.txt` â€“ Ensure scraping is allowed  
âœ… Use timeouts & delays â€“ Avoid overwhelming servers  
âœ… Avoid unnecessary requests â€“ Download only what you need
